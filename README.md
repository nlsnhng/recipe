# Thanksgiving Pudding II

The recipe is from the cookbook "The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book" 
by Fannie Farmer which was originally published in 1896.

The name of the recipe seem to suggested that the budding is intended to be a desert served during Thanksgiving.

I found the recipe on [the Henry Ford website](https://www.thehenryford.org/explore/recipes-and-cookbooks/recipe/thanksgiving-pudding/) using Google.
